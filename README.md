 PROJECT: Tic Tac Toe with Minimax AI and UI Enhancements

Description:
Developed an advanced version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game incorporating AI using the Minimax algorithm. The game allows Player vs Player and Player vs AI modes, with difficulty levels. Includes a clean, responsive user interface and game state tracking.

Technologies & Tools Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Minimax Algorithm (with optional Alpha-Beta pruning)

Responsive Web Design

DOM Manipulation and Game Logic


Key Features:

Single Player vs AI (Unbeatable) and Two Player Modes

Difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard)

Real-time board updates with win/draw detection

Sound effects and UI animations (optional)

Clean, user-friendly interface

Fully responsive across devices

🔑 Key Learnings

1. Minimax Algorithm
Learned how to implement AI that never loses using the Minimax decision-making algorithm for turn-based games.


2. Game Logic Design
Gained experience in designing a fully functional turn-based game with conditions like win, draw, and restart.


3. DOM Manipulation
Practiced handling dynamic updates to the UI using JavaScript and event listeners.


4. Responsive UI Design
Learned to create a simple, clean user interface that works across desktops and mobiles.


5. Version Control
Understood how to use Git and GitHub for uploading code, tracking changes, and publishing live demos.
