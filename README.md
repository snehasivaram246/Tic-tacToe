 PROJECT: Tic Tac Toe with Minimax AI and UI Enhancements

DESCRIPTION:
Developed an advanced version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game incorporating AI using the Minimax algorithm. The game allows Player vs Player and Player vs AI modes, with difficulty levels. Includes a clean, responsive user interface and game state tracking.

TECHNOLOGIES & TOOLS USED:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Minimax Algorithm (with optional Alpha-Beta pruning)

Responsive Web Design

DOM Manipulation and Game Logic


KEY FEATURES:

Single Player vs AI (Unbeatable) and Two Player Modes

Difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard)

Real-time board updates with win/draw detection

Sound effects and UI animations (optional)

Clean, user-friendly interface

Fully responsive across devices
